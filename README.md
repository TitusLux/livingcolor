# LivingColor

Draw something, then watch AI bring it to life. The AI sees your drawing, reacts in a kid-friendly chat, generates a polished version, and animates it.

## User Manual

1. Open `index.html` in a browser (or `python3 -m http.server 8090` for local serving).
2. Draw on the canvas — pencil, eraser, paint bucket (with patterns: solid, rainbow, sunset, ocean, fire, forest).
3. Click **Bring to Life! ✨**.
4. The AI guesses what you drew and asks if it got it right. Click **Yes! ✅** / **Hmm 🤔** / **It's a…** or pick an emoji from the grid.
5. A polished AI image appears, then animation kicks in: either a real video (Veo / LTX) or a client-side "living" effect (breathing + sparkles).
6. Chat freely with the AI any time using the input at the bottom. Press **Esc** to stop current work.

Optional: toggle **Reimagine** (default, AI creates magical interpretation) vs **Faithful** (preserves your drawing's style).

## Features

### Drawing tools
- **Pencil** with adjustable brush size (1-80px)
- **Eraser**
- **Paint bucket** with flood fill + 6 patterns (solid / rainbow / sunset / ocean / fire / forest)
- 16-color palette + custom color picker
- **Undo** (Ctrl+Z, 30 levels)
- **Clear canvas**

### AI conversation
- **Vision recognition** with character preservation — captures composition (full figure / headshot / wide scene), details (body parts, action), and character (proportions, quirks, expression)
- **Toddler-friendly chat** — warm, simple, emoji-rich personality
- **Always-on chat input** — type anytime, press Enter or click → to send
- **System log messages** — see which AI provider is being tried ("Trying Gemini Vision… / Gemini rate limited, trying Perplexity…")
- **Emoji grid fallback** if AI guesses wrong — 16 common subjects

### AI providers (fallback chain)
1. **Local Claude Code** (your Max subscription) — when Flask backend is running and toggle is on
2. **Gemini 2.5 Flash Vision** — browser-side, obfuscated key
3. **Perplexity Sonar** — browser-side, your API key (split to avoid scanners)

### Image generation
- **Pollinations.ai** — free, no auth, 768×768 polished image
- Composition + character preserved from the original drawing
- Optional style hint ("watercolor", "pixel art", etc.)

### Animation (video fallback chain)
1. **Veo 3.1** — best, 6-sec AI video, via Gemini key (subject to quota)
2. **LTX Video** — free 2-sec via HuggingFace Spaces (subject to GPU quota)
3. **Wan2GP local** — runs on your RTX 3060+ (in progress, needs CUDA 13 driver)
4. **Client-side "living" effect** — breathing scale + tilt + golden sparkles on the still image

### Persistence
- **Conversation log** — every event captured to localStorage with timestamps. Click gear icon → **Download conversation log** for debugging.
- **Drawing archive** (when Flask running) — saves human drawings + AI outputs to `/mnt/d/livingcolor/` (configurable, see Architecture)

### Architecture decisions
- **Static-first** — works on GitHub Pages with zero server, browser handles everything
- **Optional Flask backend** — adds Claude Code via user's subscription (CLI shellout) and drawing archive
- **ES modules with `type="module"`** — no bundler, clean imports
- **State module with getters/setters** — shared state without globals
- **API key obfuscation** — XOR encoding in setup.js avoids GitHub secret scanners
- **`referrerpolicy="no-referrer"`** on Pollinations images — they reject requests with a Referer header
- **Cross-origin fetch** uses `gradio_client` CDN for LTX, direct fetch for everything else

### Status (2026-05-28)
- ✅ Drawing tools (all working)
- ✅ Chat-based conversation with composition + character preservation
- ✅ Image generation (Pollinations, always works)
- ✅ Client-side "living" effect on still images (breathing + sparkles)
- ✅ Conversation log (localStorage + downloadable)
- ✅ 42/42 unit tests passing
- ⚠️ Veo video — requires Gemini key with quota (free tier easily exhausted)
- ⚠️ LTX Video — requires HuggingFace ZeroGPU quota (free, exhausted easily)
- 🔄 Wan2GP local — installed, blocked on CUDA driver update (in progress)
- 📝 Drawing archive — see CLAUDE.md, runs server-side only
- 📝 Vector motion — Claude Code generates motion plan, frontend animates (in progress)
